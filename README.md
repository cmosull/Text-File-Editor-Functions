## Text-File-Editor-Functions

## Description 
This is a command-line program that can perform Search and Replace or Spell Check on text (.txt) files. The program takes 3 arguments, an input txt file, an output .txt file (does not need to exist previously), and a dictionary txt file. The program generates a simple menu interface for users to interact with. Fairly simple design, not too complicated to work with. I provided two different dictionaries to work with, one very robust dictionary taken from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words, and a less-robust dictionary file.

## Tools Used
  * Compiled using gcc Version 7.4.0 on Ubuntu 18.04.01
  * Libraries included:
    * stdio.h
    * stdlib.h
    * string.h
    * ctype.h
  * An executable is offered for those who do not want to compile the source code themselves
